Log files
=========

In each run, snf-burnin stores log files in the folder defined in the
--log-foler parameter, under the folder with the timestamp of the
snf-burnin-run and the image used for it. The name prefixes of the log
files are:

* details: Showing the complete log of snf-burnin run.
* error: Showing the testcases that encountered a runtime error.
* failed: Showing the testcases that encountered a failure.

Example scripts
===============

Under /snf-tools/conf you can find example scripts for automating snf-burnin
testing using cron.

* **snf-burnin-run.sh** runs snf-burnin with the given parameters, deletes
  stale instances (servers, networks) from old runs and delete logs older
  than a week. It aborts if snf-burnin runs for longer than expected.

* **snf-burnin-output.sh** checks for failed snf-burnin tests the last 30
  minutes in a given log folder. Exit status is 0 if no failures were
  encountered, else exit status is 1.
