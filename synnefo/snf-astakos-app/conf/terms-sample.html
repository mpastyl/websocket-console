We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with
our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise
permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding
or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal

Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This content is the
sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review
content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we
may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates
our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review
content, so please don’t assume that we do.
