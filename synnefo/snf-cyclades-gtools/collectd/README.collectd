=======
snf-cyclades-gtools installs a Python collectd plugin, which collects stats
about the Ganeti VMs running on the host.

The plugin is installed under /usr/lib/snf-cyclades-gtools/collectd/.

The necessary plugin configuration is performed by
/etc/collectd/ganeti-stats.conf.

To enable the plugin, add in your original collectd configuration file the
following line:
 
 Include /etc/collectd/ganeti-stats.conf

An example collectd configuration, which enables the plugin, is also installed
in /usr/shared/doc/snf-cyclades-gtools/examples/ganeti-stats-collectd.conf.
