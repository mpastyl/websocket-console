v0.14
=====

Released: Tue Jun 25 14:01:19 EEST 2013

Synnefo-wide
------------

* Create 'snf_django' Python package to hold common code for all Synnefo
  components.

* Create a JSON-exportable definition document for each Synnefo Components
  (Astakos, Cyclades, Pithos, etc.) that consolidates APIs (services),
  resources, and other standardized properties (e.g. default URL prefixes).

* Standardize URLs for Synnefo Components, impose structure and naming
  conventions to related settings. Make each component deployable under
  a user-configurable <COMPONENT>_BASE_URL. Each API (compute, image, etc.)
  is deployable under a developer-configurable prefix beneath BASE_URL.

* Deprecate CLOUDBAR_ACTIVE_SERVICE setting from all apps. 

* Common synnefo 404/500 templates (located in snf-webproject)

Astakos
-------

* Redesign of the accounting system (quotaholder) and integration into
  Astakos.

  * Simplified the quotaholder model; removed tables Entity and Policy; now
    table Holding contains limit and usage for every holding.
  * Extended table Holding, so that we can keep track of quota for every
    valid combination of holder (e.g. user), resource, and source (e.g. the
    default system or some specific project).
  * Refactored code for issuing and resolving commissions for robustness;
    added a 'force' option to bypass the upper limit check when issuing a
    commission.
  * Simplified syncing to the quotaholder; removed fields from models
    Project and ProjectMembership, previously needed for syncing; removed
    state PROJECT_DEACTIVATED from ProjectMembership.
  * Removed settings ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_URL, ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_TOKEN,
    and ASTAKOS_QUOTAHOLDER_POOLSIZE.

* API-related changes:

  * Implemented API calls for quota, resources, and commissions.
  * Moved all API calls under '/account/v1.0'.
  * Implemented the keystone API call POST /tokens under '/identity/v2.0'.

* Service and resource specification and handling:

  * Specified a format for defining services along with the API endpoints
    and the resources they expose. Migrated internal resource name by
    prefixing it with service name (e.g. 'vm' becomes 'cyclades.vm');
    renamed registered service 'pithos+' to 'pithos'.
  * Specified a procedure to register a Synnefo component, its services and
    their resources in astakos and set the resources' default base quota
    limit. Removed resource definitions from settings.
  * Moved service and resource presentation data out of the respective db
    models into a separate file of UI constants.

* Converted the limit on pending applications from a setting to a quotable
  resource. Converted the related user setting to a user-specific base quota
  limit. Deprecated model UserSetting; removed setting
  ASTAKOS_PENDING_APPLICATION_LIMIT.

* Changes in locking strategy:

  * Lock only project's chain for all project operations; lock user before
    syncing to quotaholder.
  * When locking multiple rows (e.g. users or holdings) include an ORDER BY
    clause in the query to impose ordering on locking.

* Changes in views:

  * Replaced custom transaction context with a simple decorator for managing
    transactions and a context 'ExceptionHandler', which logs and suppresses
    exceptions

* Added fine grain user auth provider's policies.

  * Administrator can override default auth provider policies to a specific 
    user or group of users.
  * Optionally a user can be assigned to a list of groups, based on the
    authentication method he choosed to signup.

* Removed explicit handling of SMTP errors on each email delivery. Exceptions 
  are now propagated to base django exception handler.

* Email used in html/email tempaltes which prompt user to contact for service 
  support prompts is now defined in ``CONTACT_EMAIL`` setting introduced in 
  snf-common settings.

* Improvements in user activation flow

  * User moderation now takes place after the user has verified his email
    address.
  * User model enriched with additional user state fields
  * Split activation email from moderation process. Administrator is required 
    to moderate user explicitly using the `user-modify --accept` or
    `user-modify --reject` commands.
  * Improved logging throught out user activation procedures.

* Remove deprecated AstakosUser model fields: `provider`,
  `third_party_identifier`

* Allow override of authentication provider messages using the following 
  format in setting names: ``ASTAKOS_<PROVIDER_MODULE>_<MSGID>_MSG``

* Cloudbar automatically tries to identify the active service based on window 
  location.

* Removing authentication provider view is now CSRF protected.

* New `API access` view, containing useful information to users on how to 
  access available Synnefo services API's.

* Remove of ASTAKOS_*_EMAIL_SUBJECT settings. All email subjects are now 
  defined in astakos.im.messages module. Overriding default values can be 
  achieved using custom gettext files or using astakos messages settings::
	
	#change of greeting email subject
  	ASTAKOS_GREETING_EMAIL_SUBJECT_MESSAGE = 'Welcome to my cloud'

* Remove ``ASTAKOS_ACTIVATION_REDIRECT_URL`` and ``ASTAKOS_LOGIN_SUCCESS_URL`` 
  from astakos .conf file. Settings are dynamically computed based on 
  ``ASTAKOS_BASE_URL``.

* Management commands:

  * Introduced new commands:
     * authpolicy-{add, list, remove, set, show}
     * group-{add, list}
     * component-{add, list, modify, remove}
     * reconcile-resources-astakos
     * resource-{export-astakos, import, modify}
     * service-{export-astakos, import, show}
  * Renamed commands:
     * astakos-quota to quota
     * user-update to user-modify
     * full-cleanup to cleanup-full
  * Removed commands:
     * astakos-init
     * invitation-{details, list}
     * project-sync
     * resource-{add, remove}
     * service-{add, remove, token-renew, update}
     * user-invite
     * user-set-initial-quota (integrated its functionality in user-modify and quota)
  * Added quota and project-related information in user-show command; added
    membership information in project-show.

Cyclades
--------

* Make 'type' attribute required for network create API request.
* Networks not created to all Ganeti backends upon creation, they are instead
  created to a backend only when a VM connects to the network.

  http connection pool to astakos.
* Remove 'CYCLADES_USER_CATALOG_URL' and 'CYCLADES_USER_FEEDBACK_URL' settings

  'reconcile-commissions-cyclades'.
* Remove obsolete 'MAX_VMS_PER_USER', 'MAX_NETWORKS_PER_USER',
