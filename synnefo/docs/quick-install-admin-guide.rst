Administrator's Installation Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the Administrator's installation guide.

It describes how to install the whole synnefo stack on two (2) physical nodes,
with minimum configuration. It installs synnefo from Debian packages, and
assumes the nodes run Debian Squeeze. After successful installation, you will
have the following services running:

    * Identity Management (Astakos)
    * Object Storage Service (Pithos)
    * Compute Service (Cyclades)
    * Image Service (part of Cyclades)
    * Network Service (part of Cyclades)

and a single unified Web UI to manage them all.

The Volume Storage Service (Archipelago) and the Billing Service (Aquarium) are
not released yet.

If you just want to install the Object Storage Service (Pithos), follow the
guide and just stop after the "Testing of Pithos" section.


Installation of Synnefo / Introduction
======================================

We will install the services with the above list's order. The last three
services will be installed in a single step (at the end), because at the moment
they are contained in the same software component (Cyclades). Furthermore, we
will install all services in the first physical node, except Pithos which will
be installed in the second, due to a conflict between the snf-pithos-app and
snf-cyclades-app component (scheduled to be fixed in the next version).

For the rest of the documentation we will refer to the first physical node as
"node1" and the second as "node2". We will also assume that their domain names
are "node1.example.com" and "node2.example.com" and their IPs are "4.3.2.1" and
"4.3.2.2" respectively.

.. note:: It is import that the two machines are under the same domain name.
    If they are not, you can do this by editting the file ``/etc/hosts``
    on both machines, and add the following lines:

    .. code-block:: console

        4.3.2.1     node1.example.com
        4.3.2.2     node2.example.com


General Prerequisites
=====================

These are the general synnefo prerequisites, that you need on node1 and node2
and are related to all the services (Astakos, Pithos, Cyclades).

To be able to download all synnefo components you need to add the following
lines in your ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` file:

| ``deb http://apt.dev.grnet.gr squeeze/``
| ``deb-src http://apt.dev.grnet.gr squeeze/``

and import the repo's GPG key:

| ``curl https://dev.grnet.gr/files/apt-grnetdev.pub | apt-key add -``

Also add the following line to enable the ``squeeze-backports`` repository,
which may provide more recent versions of certain packages. The repository
is deactivated by default and must be specified expicitly in ``apt-get``
operations:

| ``deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main``

You also need a shared directory visible by both nodes. Pithos will save all
data inside this directory. By 'all data', we mean files, images, and pithos
specific mapping data. If you plan to upload more than one basic image, this
directory should have at least 50GB of free space. During this guide, we will
assume that node1 acts as an NFS server and serves the directory ``/srv/pithos``
to node2 (be sure to set no_root_squash flag). Node2 has this directory
mounted under ``/srv/pithos``, too.

Before starting the synnefo installation, you will need basic third party
software to be installed and configured on the physical nodes. We will describe
each node's general prerequisites separately. Any additional configuration,
specific to a synnefo service for each node, will be described at the service's
section.

Finally, it is required for Cyclades and Ganeti nodes to have synchronized
system clocks (e.g. by running ntpd).

Node1
-----

General Synnefo dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * apache (http server)
    * gunicorn (WSGI http server)
    * postgresql (database)
    * rabbitmq (message queue)
    * ntp (NTP daemon)
    * gevent

You can install apache2, progresql and ntp by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install apache2 postgresql ntp

Make sure to install gunicorn >= v0.12.2. You can do this by installing from
the official debian backports:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get -t squeeze-backports install gunicorn

Also, make sure to install gevent >= 0.13.6. Again from the debian backports:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get -t squeeze-backports install python-gevent

On node1, we will create our databases, so you will also need the
python-psycopg2 package:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install python-psycopg2

To install RabbitMQ>=2.8.4, use the RabbitMQ APT repository by adding the
following line to ``/etc/apt/sources.list``:

.. code-block:: console

    deb http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian testing main

Add RabbitMQ public key, to trusted key list:

.. code-block:: console

  # wget http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc
  # apt-key add rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc

Finally, to install the package run:

.. code-block:: console

  # apt-get update
  # apt-get install rabbitmq-server

Database setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On node1, we create a database called ``snf_apps``, that will host all django
apps related tables. We also create the user ``synnefo`` and grant him all
privileges on the database. We do this by running:

.. code-block:: console

    root@node1:~ # su - postgres
    postgres@node1:~ $ psql
    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE snf_apps WITH ENCODING 'UTF8' LC_COLLATE='C' LC_CTYPE='C' TEMPLATE=template0;
    postgres=# CREATE USER synnefo WITH PASSWORD 'example_passw0rd';
    postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE snf_apps TO synnefo;

We also create the database ``snf_pithos`` needed by the Pithos backend and
grant the ``synnefo`` user all privileges on the database. This database could
be created on node2 instead, but we do it on node1 for simplicity. We will
create all needed databases on node1 and then node2 will connect to them.

.. code-block:: console

    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE snf_pithos WITH ENCODING 'UTF8' LC_COLLATE='C' LC_CTYPE='C' TEMPLATE=template0;
    postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE snf_pithos TO synnefo;

Configure the database to listen to all network interfaces. You can do this by
editting the file ``/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf`` and change
``listen_addresses`` to ``'*'`` :

.. code-block:: console

    listen_addresses = '*'

Furthermore, edit ``/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf`` to allow node1 and
node2 to connect to the database. Add the following lines under ``#IPv4 local
connections:`` :

.. code-block:: console

    host		all	all	4.3.2.1/32	md5
    host		all	all	4.3.2.2/32	md5

Make sure to substitute "4.3.2.1" and "4.3.2.2" with node1's and node2's
actual IPs. Now, restart the server to apply the changes:

.. code-block:: console

   # /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Gunicorn setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the file ``/etc/gunicorn.d/synnefo`` containing the following:

.. code-block:: console

    CONFIG = {
     'mode': 'django',
     'environment': {
       'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE': 'synnefo.settings',
     },
     'working_dir': '/etc/synnefo',
     'user': 'www-data',
     'group': 'www-data',
     'args': (
       '--bind=127.0.0.1:8080',
       '--worker-class=gevent',
       '--workers=8',
       '--log-level=debug',
     ),
    }

.. warning:: Do NOT start the server yet, because it won't find the
    ``synnefo.settings`` module. Also, in case you are using ``/etc/hosts``
    instead of a DNS to get the hostnames, change ``--worker-class=gevent`` to
    ``--worker-class=sync``. We will start the server after successful
    installation of astakos. If the server is running::

       # /etc/init.d/gunicorn stop

Apache2 setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the file ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/synnefo`` containing the
following:

.. code-block:: console

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName node1.example.com

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^.*(\\r|\\n|%0A|%0D).* [NC]
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F,L]
        RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
    </VirtualHost>

Create the file ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/synnefo-ssl`` containing the
following:

.. code-block:: console

    <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost _default_:443>
        ServerName node1.example.com

        Alias /static "/usr/share/synnefo/static"

        #  SetEnv no-gzip
        #  SetEnv dont-vary

       AllowEncodedSlashes On

       RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Protocol "https"

    <Proxy * >
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>

        SetEnv                proxy-sendchunked
        SSLProxyEngine        off
        ProxyErrorOverride    off

        ProxyPass        /static !
        ProxyPass        / http://localhost:8080/ retry=0
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^.*(\\r|\\n|%0A|%0D).* [NC]
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F,L]

        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
    </VirtualHost>
    </IfModule>

Now enable sites and modules by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # a2enmod ssl
   # a2enmod rewrite
   # a2dissite default
   # a2ensite synnefo
   # a2ensite synnefo-ssl
   # a2enmod headers
   # a2enmod proxy_http

.. warning:: Do NOT start/restart the server yet. If the server is running::

       # /etc/init.d/apache2 stop

.. _rabbitmq-setup:

Message Queue setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The message queue will run on node1, so we need to create the appropriate
rabbitmq user. The user is named ``synnefo`` and gets full privileges on all
exchanges:

.. code-block:: console

   # rabbitmqctl add_user synnefo "example_rabbitmq_passw0rd"
   # rabbitmqctl set_permissions synnefo ".*" ".*" ".*"

We do not need to initialize the exchanges. This will be done automatically,
during the Cyclades setup.

Pithos data directory setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned in the General Prerequisites section, there is a directory called
``/srv/pithos`` visible by both nodes. We create and setup the ``data``
directory inside it:

.. code-block:: console

   # cd /srv/pithos
   # mkdir data
   # chown www-data:www-data data
   # chmod g+ws data

You are now ready with all general prerequisites concerning node1. Let's go to
node2.

Node2
-----

General Synnefo dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * apache (http server)
    * gunicorn (WSGI http server)
    * postgresql (database)
    * ntp (NTP daemon)
    * gevent

You can install the above by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install apache2 postgresql ntp

Make sure to install gunicorn >= v0.12.2. You can do this by installing from
the official debian backports:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get -t squeeze-backports install gunicorn

Also, make sure to install gevent >= 0.13.6. Again from the debian backports:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get -t squeeze-backports install python-gevent

Node2 will connect to the databases on node1, so you will also need the
python-psycopg2 package:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install python-psycopg2

Database setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All databases have been created and setup on node1, so we do not need to take
any action here. From node2, we will just connect to them. When you get familiar
with the software you may choose to run different databases on different nodes,
for performance/scalability/redundancy reasons, but those kind of setups are out
of the purpose of this guide.

Gunicorn setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the file ``/etc/gunicorn.d/synnefo`` containing the following
(same contents as in node1; you can just copy/paste the file):

.. code-block:: console

    CONFIG = {
     'mode': 'django',
     'environment': {
      'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE': 'synnefo.settings',
     },
     'working_dir': '/etc/synnefo',
     'user': 'www-data',
     'group': 'www-data',
     'args': (
       '--bind=127.0.0.1:8080',
       '--worker-class=gevent',
       '--workers=4',
       '--log-level=debug',
       '--timeout=43200'
     ),
    }

.. warning:: Do NOT start the server yet, because it won't find the
    ``synnefo.settings`` module. Also, in case you are using ``/etc/hosts``
    instead of a DNS to get the hostnames, change ``--worker-class=gevent`` to
    ``--worker-class=sync``. We will start the server after successful
    installation of astakos. If the server is running::

       # /etc/init.d/gunicorn stop

Apache2 setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the file ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/synnefo`` containing the
following:

.. code-block:: console

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName node2.example.com

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^.*(\\r|\\n|%0A|%0D).* [NC]
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F,L]
        RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
    </VirtualHost>

Create the file ``synnefo-ssl`` under ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/``
containing the following:

.. code-block:: console

    <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost _default_:443>
        ServerName node2.example.com

        Alias /static "/usr/share/synnefo/static"

        SetEnv no-gzip
        SetEnv dont-vary
        AllowEncodedSlashes On

        RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Protocol "https"

        <Proxy * >
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Proxy>

        SetEnv                proxy-sendchunked
        SSLProxyEngine        off
        ProxyErrorOverride    off

        ProxyPass        /static !
        ProxyPass        / http://localhost:8080/ retry=0
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
    </VirtualHost>
    </IfModule>

As in node1, enable sites and modules by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # a2enmod ssl
   # a2enmod rewrite
   # a2dissite default
   # a2ensite synnefo
   # a2ensite synnefo-ssl
   # a2enmod headers
   # a2enmod proxy_http

.. warning:: Do NOT start/restart the server yet. If the server is running::

       # /etc/init.d/apache2 stop

We are now ready with all general prerequisites for node2. Now that we have
finished with all general prerequisites for both nodes, we can start installing
the services. First, let's install Astakos on node1.


Installation of Astakos on node1
================================

To install astakos, grab the package from our repository (make sure  you made
the additions needed in your ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` file, as described
previously), by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install snf-astakos-app snf-pithos-backend

.. _conf-astakos:

Configuration of Astakos
========================

Conf Files
----------

After astakos is successfully installed, you will find the directory
``/etc/synnefo`` and some configuration files inside it. The files contain
commented configuration options, which are the default options. While installing
new snf-* components, new configuration files will appear inside the directory.
In this guide (and for all services), we will edit only the minimum necessary
configuration options, to reflect our setup. Everything else will remain as is.

After getting familiar with synnefo, you will be able to customize the software
as you wish and fits your needs. Many options are available, to empower the
administrator with extensively customizable setups.

For the snf-webproject component (installed as an astakos dependency), we
need the following:

Edit ``/etc/synnefo/10-snf-webproject-database.conf``. You will need to
uncomment and edit the ``DATABASES`` block to reflect our database:

.. code-block:: console

    DATABASES = {
     'default': {
         # 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql','mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'
         'ENGINE': 'postgresql_psycopg2',
         # ATTENTION: This *must* be the absolute path if using sqlite3.
         # See: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#name
         'NAME': 'snf_apps',
         'USER': 'synnefo',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
         'PASSWORD': 'example_passw0rd',         # Not used with sqlite3.
         # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
         'HOST': '4.3.2.1',
         # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.
         'PORT': '5432',
     }
    }

Edit ``/etc/synnefo/10-snf-webproject-deploy.conf``. Uncomment and edit
``SECRET_KEY``. This is a Django specific setting which is used to provide a
seed in secret-key hashing algorithms. Set this to a random string of your
choice and keep it private:

.. code-block:: console

    SECRET_KEY = 'sy6)mw6a7x%n)-example_secret_key#zzk4jo6f2=uqu!1o%)'

For astakos specific configuration, edit the following options in
``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-astakos-app-settings.conf`` :

.. code-block:: console

    ASTAKOS_COOKIE_DOMAIN = '.example.com'

    ASTAKOS_BASE_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/astakos'

The ``ASTAKOS_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` should be the base url of our domain (for all
services). ``ASTAKOS_BASE_URL`` is the astakos top-level URL. Appending an
extra path (``/astakos`` here) is recommended in order to distinguish
components, if more than one are installed on the same machine.

.. note:: For the purpose of this guide, we don't enable recaptcha authentication.
    If you would like to enable it, you have to edit the following options:

    .. code-block:: console

        ASTAKOS_RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = 'example_recaptcha_public_key!@#$%^&*('
        ASTAKOS_RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = 'example_recaptcha_private_key!@#$%^&*('
        ASTAKOS_RECAPTCHA_USE_SSL = True
        ASTAKOS_RECAPTCHA_ENABLED = True

    For the ``ASTAKOS_RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY`` and ``ASTAKOS_RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY``
    go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create and create your own pair.

Then edit ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-astakos-app-cloudbar.conf`` :

.. code-block:: console

    CLOUDBAR_LOCATION = 'https://node1.example.com/static/im/cloudbar/'

    CLOUDBAR_SERVICES_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/astakos/ui/get_services'

    CLOUDBAR_MENU_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/astakos/ui/get_menu'

Those settings have to do with the black cloudbar endpoints and will be
described in more detail later on in this guide. For now, just edit the domain
to point at node1 which is where we have installed Astakos.

If you are an advanced user and want to use the Shibboleth Authentication
method, read the relative :ref:`section <shibboleth-auth>`.

.. _email-configuration:

Email delivery configuration
----------------------------

Many of the ``astakos`` operations require server to notify service users and 
administrators via email. e.g. right after the signup process the service sents 
an email to the registered email address containing an email verification url, 
after the user verifies the email address astakos once again needs to notify 
administrators with a notice that a new account has just been verified.

More specifically astakos sends emails in the following cases

- An email containing a verification link after each signup process.
- An email to the people listed in ``ADMINS`` setting after each email 
  verification if ``ASTAKOS_MODERATION`` setting is ``True``. The email 
  notifies administrators that an additional action is required in order to 
  activate the user.
- A welcome email to the user email and an admin notification to ``ADMINS`` 
  right after each account activation.
- Feedback messages submited from astakos contact view and astakos feedback 
  API endpoint are sent to contacts listed in ``HELPDESK`` setting.
- Project application request notifications to people included in ``HELPDESK`` 
  and ``MANAGERS`` settings.
- Notifications after each project members action (join request, membership 
  accepted/declinde etc.) to project members or project owners.

Astakos uses the Django internal email delivering mechanism to send email 
notifications. A simple configuration, using an external smtp server to 
deliver messages, is shown below. 

.. code-block:: python
    
    # /etc/synnefo/10-snf-common-admins.conf
    EMAIL_HOST = "mysmtp.server.synnefo.org"
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = "<smtpuser>"
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "<smtppassword>"

    # this gets appended in all email subjects
    EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX = "[example.synnefo.org] "
    
    # Address to use for outgoing emails
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = "server@example.synnefo.org"

    # Email where users can contact for support. This is used in html/email 
    # templates.
    CONTACT_EMAIL = "server@example.synnefo.org"

    # The email address that error messages come from
    SERVER_EMAIL = "server-errors@example.synnefo.org"

Notice that since email settings might be required by applications other than
astakos they are defined in a different configuration file than the one
previously used to set astakos specific settings. 

Refer to 
`Django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/email/>`_
for additional information on available email settings.

As refered in the previous section, based on the operation that triggers 
an email notification, the recipients list differs. Specifically for 
emails whose recipients include contacts from your service team 
(administrators, managers, helpdesk etc) synnefo provides the following 
settings located in ``10-snf-common-admins.conf``:

.. code-block:: python

    ADMINS = (('Admin name', 'admin@example.synnefo.org'), 
              ('Admin2 name', 'admin2@example.synnefo.org))
    MANAGERS = (('Manager name', 'manager@example.synnefo.org'),)
    HELPDESK = (('Helpdesk user name', 'helpdesk@example.synnefo.org'),)



Enable Pooling
--------------

This section can be bypassed, but we strongly recommend you apply the following,
since they result in a significant performance boost.

Synnefo includes a pooling DBAPI driver for PostgreSQL, as a thin wrapper
around Psycopg2. This allows independent Django requests to reuse pooled DB
connections, with significant performance gains.

To use, first monkey-patch psycopg2. For Django, run this before the
``DATABASES`` setting in ``/etc/synnefo/10-snf-webproject-database.conf``:

.. code-block:: console

    from synnefo.lib.db.pooled_psycopg2 import monkey_patch_psycopg2
    monkey_patch_psycopg2()

Since we are running with greenlets, we should modify psycopg2 behavior, so it
works properly in a greenlet context:

.. code-block:: console

    from synnefo.lib.db.psyco_gevent import make_psycopg_green
    make_psycopg_green()

Use the Psycopg2 driver as usual. For Django, this means using
``django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2`` without any modifications. To enable
connection pooling, pass a nonzero ``synnefo_poolsize`` option to the DBAPI
driver, through ``DATABASES.OPTIONS`` in Django.

All the above will result in an ``/etc/synnefo/10-snf-webproject-database.conf``
file that looks like this:

.. code-block:: console

    # Monkey-patch psycopg2
    from synnefo.lib.db.pooled_psycopg2 import monkey_patch_psycopg2
    monkey_patch_psycopg2()

    # If running with greenlets
    from synnefo.lib.db.psyco_gevent import make_psycopg_green
    make_psycopg_green()

    DATABASES = {
     'default': {
         # 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql','mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'
         'ENGINE': 'postgresql_psycopg2',
         'OPTIONS': {'synnefo_poolsize': 8},

         # ATTENTION: This *must* be the absolute path if using sqlite3.
         # See: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#name
         'NAME': 'snf_apps',
         'USER': 'synnefo',                      # Not used with sqlite3.
         'PASSWORD': 'example_passw0rd',         # Not used with sqlite3.
         # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
         'HOST': '4.3.2.1',
         # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.
         'PORT': '5432',
     }
    }

Database Initialization
-----------------------

After configuration is done, we initialize the database by running:

.. code-block:: console

    # snf-manage syncdb

At this example we don't need to create a django superuser, so we select
``[no]`` to the question. After a successful sync, we run the migration needed
for astakos:

.. code-block:: console

    # snf-manage migrate im
    # snf-manage migrate quotaholder_app

Then, we load the pre-defined user groups

.. code-block:: console

    # snf-manage loaddata groups

.. _services-reg:

Services Registration
---------------------

When the database is ready, we need to register the services. The following
command will ask you to register the standard Synnefo components (astakos,
cyclades, and pithos) along with the services they provide. Note that you
have to register at least astakos in order to have a usable authentication
system. For each component, you will be asked to provide two URLs: its base
URL and its UI URL.

The former is the location where the component resides; it should equal
the ``<component_name>_BASE_URL`` as specified in the respective component
settings. For example, the base URL for astakos would be
``https://node1.example.com/astakos``.

The latter is the URL that appears in the Cloudbar and leads to the
component UI. If you want to follow the default setup, set
the UI URL to ``<base_url>/ui/`` where ``base_url`` the component's base
URL as explained before. (You can later change the UI URL with
``snf-manage component-modify <component_name> --url new_ui_url``.)

The command will also register automatically the resource definitions
offered by the services.

.. code-block:: console

    # snf-component-register

.. note::

   This command is equivalent to running the following series of commands;
   it registers the three components in astakos and then in each host it
   exports the respective service definitions, copies the exported json file
   to the astakos host, where it finally imports it:

    .. code-block:: console

       astakos-host$ snf-manage component-add astakos astakos_ui_url
       astakos-host$ snf-manage component-add cyclades cyclades_ui_url
       astakos-host$ snf-manage component-add pithos pithos_ui_url
       astakos-host$ snf-manage service-export-astakos > astakos.json
       astakos-host$ snf-manage service-import --json astakos.json
       cyclades-host$ snf-manage service-export-cyclades > cyclades.json
       # copy the file to astakos-host
       astakos-host$ snf-manage service-import --json cyclades.json
       pithos-host$ snf-manage service-export-pithos > pithos.json
       # copy the file to astakos-host
       astakos-host$ snf-manage service-import --json pithos.json

Setting Default Base Quota for Resources
----------------------------------------

We now have to specify the limit on resources that each user can employ
(exempting resources offered by projects).

.. code-block:: console

    # snf-manage resource-modify --limit-interactive


Servers Initialization
----------------------

Finally, we initialize the servers on node1:

.. code-block:: console

    root@node1:~ # /etc/init.d/gunicorn restart
    root@node1:~ # /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

We have now finished the Astakos setup. Let's test it now.


Testing of Astakos
==================

Open your favorite browser and go to:

``http://node1.example.com/astakos``

If this redirects you to ``https://node1.example.com/astakos/ui/`` and you can see
the "welcome" door of Astakos, then you have successfully setup Astakos.

Let's create our first user. At the homepage click the "CREATE ACCOUNT" button
and fill all your data at the sign up form. Then click "SUBMIT". You should now
see a green box on the top, which informs you that you made a successful request
and the request has been sent to the administrators. So far so good, let's
assume that you created the user with username ``user@example.com``.

Now we need to activate that user. Return to a command prompt at node1 and run:

.. code-block:: console

    root@node1:~ # snf-manage user-list

This command should show you a list with only one user; the one we just created.
This user should have an id with a value of ``1`` and flag "active" and
"verified" set to False. Now run:

.. code-block:: console

    root@node1:~ # snf-manage user-modify 1 --verify --accept

This verifies the user email and activates the user.
When running in production, the activation is done automatically with different
types of moderation, that Astakos supports. You can see the moderation methods
(by invitation, whitelists, matching regexp, etc.) at the Astakos specific
documentation. In production, you can also manually activate a user, by sending
him/her an activation email. See how to do this at the :ref:`User
activation <user_activation>` section.

Now let's go back to the homepage. Open ``http://node1.example.com/astkos/ui/`` with
your browser again. Try to sign in using your new credentials. If the astakos
menu appears and you can see your profile, then you have successfully setup
Astakos.

Let's continue to install Pithos now.


Installation of Pithos on node2
===============================

To install Pithos, grab the packages from our repository (make sure  you made
the additions needed in your ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` file, as described
previously), by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install snf-pithos-app snf-pithos-backend

Now, install the pithos web interface:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install snf-pithos-webclient

This package provides the standalone pithos web client. The web client is the
web UI for Pithos and will be accessible by clicking "pithos" on the Astakos
interface's cloudbar, at the top of the Astakos homepage.


.. _conf-pithos:

Configuration of Pithos
=======================

Conf Files
----------

After Pithos is successfully installed, you will find the directory
``/etc/synnefo`` and some configuration files inside it, as you did in node1
after installation of astakos. Here, you will not have to change anything that
has to do with snf-common or snf-webproject. Everything is set at node1. You
only need to change settings that have to do with Pithos. Specifically:

Edit ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-pithos-app-settings.conf``. There you need to set
this options:

.. code-block:: console

   ASTAKOS_BASE_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/astakos'

   PITHOS_BASE_URL = 'https://node2.example.com/pithos'
   PITHOS_BACKEND_DB_CONNECTION = 'postgresql://synnefo:example_passw0rd@node1.example.com:5432/snf_pithos'
   PITHOS_BACKEND_BLOCK_PATH = '/srv/pithos/data'

   PITHOS_SERVICE_TOKEN = 'pithos_service_token22w'

   # Set to False if astakos & pithos are on the same host
   PITHOS_PROXY_USER_SERVICES = True


The ``PITHOS_BACKEND_DB_CONNECTION`` option tells to the Pithos app where to
find the Pithos backend database. Above we tell Pithos that its database is
``snf_pithos`` at node1 and to connect as user ``synnefo`` with password
``example_passw0rd``.  All those settings where setup during node1's "Database
setup" section.

The ``PITHOS_BACKEND_BLOCK_PATH`` option tells to the Pithos app where to find
the Pithos backend data. Above we tell Pithos to store its data under
``/srv/pithos/data``, which is visible by both nodes. We have already setup this
directory at node1's "Pithos data directory setup" section.

The ``ASTAKOS_BASE_URL`` option informs the Pithos app where Astakos is.
The Astakos service is used for user management (authentication, quotas, etc.)

The ``PITHOS_BASE_URL`` setting must point to the top-level Pithos URL.

The ``PITHOS_SERVICE_TOKEN`` is the token used for authentication with astakos.
It can be retrieved by running on the Astakos node (node1 in our case):

.. code-block:: console

   # snf-manage component-list

The token has been generated automatically during the :ref:`Pithos service
registration <services-reg>`.

The ``PITHOS_UPDATE_MD5`` option by default disables the computation of the
object checksums. This results to improved performance during object uploading.
However, if compatibility with the OpenStack Object Storage API is important
then it should be changed to ``True``.

Then edit ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-pithos-webclient-cloudbar.conf``, to connect the
Pithos web UI with the astakos web UI (through the top cloudbar):

.. code-block:: console

    CLOUDBAR_LOCATION = 'https://node1.example.com/static/im/cloudbar/'
    CLOUDBAR_SERVICES_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/astakos/ui/get_services'
    CLOUDBAR_MENU_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/astakos/ui/get_menu'

The ``CLOUDBAR_LOCATION`` tells the client where to find the astakos common
cloudbar.

The ``CLOUDBAR_SERVICES_URL`` and ``CLOUDBAR_MENU_URL`` options are used by the
Pithos web client to get from astakos all the information needed to fill its
own cloudbar. So we put our astakos deployment urls there.

Pooling and Greenlets
---------------------

Pithos is pooling-ready without the need of further configuration, because it
doesn't use a Django DB. It pools HTTP connections to Astakos and pithos
backend objects for access to the Pithos DB.

However, as in Astakos, since we are running with Greenlets, it is also
recommended to modify psycopg2 behavior so it works properly in a greenlet
context. This means adding the following lines at the top of your
``/etc/synnefo/10-snf-webproject-database.conf`` file:

.. code-block:: console

    from synnefo.lib.db.psyco_gevent import make_psycopg_green
    make_psycopg_green()

Furthermore, add the ``--worker-class=gevent`` (or ``--worker-class=sync`` as
mentioned above, depending on your setup) argument on your
``/etc/gunicorn.d/synnefo`` configuration file. The file should look something
like this:

.. code-block:: console

    CONFIG = {
     'mode': 'django',
     'environment': {
       'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE': 'synnefo.settings',
     },
     'working_dir': '/etc/synnefo',
     'user': 'www-data',
     'group': 'www-data',
     'args': (
       '--bind=127.0.0.1:8080',
       '--workers=4',
       '--worker-class=gevent',
       '--log-level=debug',
       '--timeout=43200'
     ),
    }

Stamp Database Revision
-----------------------

Pithos uses the alembic_ database migrations tool.

.. _alembic: http://alembic.readthedocs.org

After a successful installation, we should stamp it at the most recent
revision, so that future migrations know where to start upgrading in
the migration history.

.. code-block:: console

    root@node2:~ # pithos-migrate stamp head

Servers Initialization
----------------------

After configuration is done, we initialize the servers on node2:

.. code-block:: console

    root@node2:~ # /etc/init.d/gunicorn restart
    root@node2:~ # /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

You have now finished the Pithos setup. Let's test it now.


Testing of Pithos
=================

Open your browser and go to the Astakos homepage:

``http://node1.example.com/astakos``

Login, and you will see your profile page. Now, click the "pithos" link on the
top black cloudbar. If everything was setup correctly, this will redirect you
to:


and you will see the blue interface of the Pithos application.  Click the
orange "Upload" button and upload your first file. If the file gets uploaded
successfully, then this is your first sign of a successful Pithos installation.
Go ahead and experiment with the interface to make sure everything works
correctly.

You can also use the Pithos clients to sync data from your Windows PC or MAC.

If you don't stumble on any problems, then you have successfully installed
Pithos, which you can use as a standalone File Storage Service.

If you would like to do more, such as:

    * Spawning VMs
    * Spawning VMs from Images stored on Pithos
    * Uploading your custom Images to Pithos
    * Spawning VMs from those custom Images
    * Registering existing Pithos files as Images
    * Connect VMs to the Internet
    * Create Private Networks
    * Add VMs to Private Networks

please continue with the rest of the guide.


Cyclades Prerequisites
======================

Before proceeding with the Cyclades installation, make sure you have
successfully set up Astakos and Pithos first, because Cyclades depends on
them. If you don't have a working Astakos and Pithos installation yet, please
return to the :ref:`top <quick-install-admin-guide>` of this guide.

Besides Astakos and Pithos, you will also need a number of additional working
prerequisites, before you start the Cyclades installation.

Ganeti
------

`Ganeti <http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/>`_ handles the low level VM management
for Cyclades, so Cyclades requires a working Ganeti installation at the backend.
Please refer to the
`ganeti documentation <http://docs.ganeti.org/ganeti/2.6/html>`_ for all the
gory details. A successful Ganeti installation concludes with a working
:ref:`GANETI-MASTER <GANETI_NODES>` and a number of :ref:`GANETI-NODEs
<GANETI_NODES>`.

The above Ganeti cluster can run on different physical machines than node1 and
node2 and can scale independently, according to your needs.

For the purpose of this guide, we will assume that the :ref:`GANETI-MASTER
<GANETI_NODES>` runs on node1 and is VM-capable. Also, node2 is a
:ref:`GANETI-NODE <GANETI_NODES>` and is Master-capable and VM-capable too.

We highly recommend that you read the official Ganeti documentation, if you are
not familiar with Ganeti.

Unfortunatelly, the current stable version of the stock Ganeti (v2.6.2) doesn't
support IP pool management. This feature will be available in Ganeti >= 2.7.
Synnefo depends on the IP pool functionality of Ganeti, so you have to use
GRNET provided packages until stable 2.7 is out. To do so:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install snf-ganeti ganeti-htools
   # rmmod -f drbd && modprobe drbd minor_count=255 usermode_helper=/bin/true

You should have:

Ganeti >= 2.6.2+ippool11+hotplug5+extstorage3+rdbfix1+kvmfix2-1

We assume that Ganeti will use the KVM hypervisor. After installing Ganeti on
both nodes, choose a domain name that resolves to a valid floating IP (let's
say it's ``ganeti.node1.example.com``). Make sure node1 and node2 have same
dsa/rsa keys and authorised_keys for password-less root ssh between each other.
If not then skip passing --no-ssh-init but be aware that it will replace
/root/.ssh/* related files and you might lose access to master node. Also,
make sure there is an lvm volume group named ``ganeti`` that will host your
VMs' disks. Finally, setup a bridge interface on the host machines (e.g: br0).
Then run on node1:

.. code-block:: console

    root@node1:~ # gnt-cluster init --enabled-hypervisors=kvm --no-ssh-init \
                    --no-etc-hosts --vg-name=ganeti --nic-parameters link=br0 \
                    --master-netdev eth0 ganeti.node1.example.com
    root@node1:~ # gnt-cluster modify --default-iallocator hail
    root@node1:~ # gnt-cluster modify --hypervisor-parameters kvm:kernel_path=
    root@node1:~ # gnt-cluster modify --hypervisor-parameters kvm:vnc_bind_address=0.0.0.0

    root@node1:~ # gnt-node add --no-ssh-key-check --master-capable=yes \
                    --vm-capable=yes node2.example.com
    root@node1:~ # gnt-cluster modify --disk-parameters=drbd:metavg=ganeti
    root@node1:~ # gnt-group modify --disk-parameters=drbd:metavg=ganeti default

For any problems you may stumble upon installing Ganeti, please refer to the
`official documentation <http://docs.ganeti.org/ganeti/2.6/html>`_. Installation
of Ganeti is out of the scope of this guide.

.. _cyclades-install-snfimage:

snf-image
---------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
For :ref:`Cyclades <cyclades>` to be able to launch VMs from specified Images,
you need the :ref:`snf-image <snf-image>` OS Definition installed on *all*
VM-capable Ganeti nodes. This means we need :ref:`snf-image <snf-image>` on
node1 and node2. You can do this by running on *both* nodes:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install snf-image snf-pithos-backend python-psycopg2

snf-image also needs the `snf-pithos-backend <snf-pithos-backend>`, to be able
to handle image files stored on Pithos. It also needs `python-psycopg2` to be
able to access the Pithos database. This is why, we also install them on *all*
VM-capable Ganeti nodes.

.. warning:: snf-image uses ``curl`` for handling URLs. This means that it will
    not  work out of the box if you try to use URLs served by servers which do
    not have a valid certificate. To circumvent this you should edit the file
    ``/etc/default/snf-image``. Change ``#CURL="curl"`` to ``CURL="curl -k"``.

After `snf-image` has been installed successfully, create the helper VM by
running on *both* nodes:

.. code-block:: console

   # snf-image-update-helper

This will create all the needed files under ``/var/lib/snf-image/helper/`` for
snf-image to run successfully, and it may take a few minutes depending on your
Internet connection.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
snf-image supports native access to Images stored on Pithos. This means that
it can talk directly to the Pithos backend, without the need of providing a
public URL. More details, are described in the next section. For now, the only
thing we need to do, is configure snf-image to access our Pithos backend.

To do this, we need to set the corresponding variables in
``/etc/default/snf-image``, to reflect our Pithos setup:

.. code-block:: console

    PITHOS_DB="postgresql://synnefo:example_passw0rd@node1.example.com:5432/snf_pithos"

    PITHOS_DATA="/srv/pithos/data"

If you have installed your Ganeti cluster on different nodes than node1 and
node2 make sure that ``/srv/pithos/data`` is visible by all of them.

If you would like to use Images that are also/only stored locally, you need to
save them under ``IMAGE_DIR``, however this guide targets Images stored only on
Pithos.

Testing
~~~~~~~
You can test that snf-image is successfully installed by running on the
:ref:`GANETI-MASTER <GANETI_NODES>` (in our case node1):

.. code-block:: console

   # gnt-os diagnose

This should return ``valid`` for snf-image.

If you are interested to learn more about snf-image's internals (and even use
it alongside Ganeti without Synnefo), please see
`here <https://code.grnet.gr/projects/snf-image/wiki>`_ for information
concerning installation instructions, documentation on the design and
implementation, and supported Image formats.

.. _snf-image-images:

Actual Images for snf-image
---------------------------

Now that snf-image is installed successfully we need to provide it with some
Images. :ref:`snf-image <snf-image>` supports Images stored in ``extdump``,
``ntfsdump`` or ``diskdump`` format. We recommend the use of the ``diskdump``
format. For more information about snf-image Image formats see `here
<https://code.grnet.gr/projects/snf-image/wiki/Image_Format>`_.

:ref:`snf-image <snf-image>` also supports three (3) different locations for the
above Images to be stored:

    * Under a local folder (usually an NFS mount, configurable as ``IMAGE_DIR``
      in :file:`/etc/default/snf-image`)
    * On a remote host (accessible via public URL e.g: http://... or ftp://...)
    * On Pithos (accessible natively, not only by its public URL)

For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Debian Squeeze Base Image found
on the official `snf-image page
<https://code.grnet.gr/projects/snf-image/wiki#Sample-Images>`_. The image is
of type ``diskdump``. We will store it in our new Pithos installation.

To do so, do the following:

a) Download the Image from the official snf-image page.

b) Upload the Image to your Pithos installation, either using the Pithos Web
   UI or the command line client `kamaki
   <http://www.synnefo.org/docs/kamaki/latest/index.html>`_.

Once the Image is uploaded successfully, download the Image's metadata file
from the official snf-image page. You will need it, for spawning a VM from
Ganeti, in the next section.

Of course, you can repeat the procedure to upload more Images, available from
the `official snf-image page
<https://code.grnet.gr/projects/snf-image/wiki#Sample-Images>`_.

.. _ganeti-with-pithos-images:

Spawning a VM from a Pithos Image, using Ganeti
-----------------------------------------------

Now, it is time to test our installation so far. So, we have Astakos and
Pithos installed, we have a working Ganeti installation, the snf-image
definition installed on all VM-capable nodes and a Debian Squeeze Image on
Pithos. Make sure you also have the `metadata file
<https://pithos.okeanos.grnet.gr/public/gwqcv>`_ for this image.

Run on the :ref:`GANETI-MASTER's <GANETI_NODES>` (node1) command line:

.. code-block:: console

   # gnt-instance add -o snf-image+default --os-parameters \
                      img_passwd=my_vm_example_passw0rd,img_format=diskdump,img_id="pithos://UUID/pithos/debian_base-6.0-7-x86_64.diskdump",img_properties='{"OSFAMILY":"linux"\,"ROOT_PARTITION":"1"}' \
                      -t plain --disk 0:size=2G --no-name-check --no-ip-check \
                      testvm1

In the above command:

 * ``img_passwd``: the arbitrary root password of your new instance
 * ``img_format``: set to ``diskdump`` to reflect the type of the uploaded Image
 * ``img_id``: If you want to deploy an Image stored on Pithos (our case), this
               should have the format ``pithos://<UUID>/<container>/<filename>``:
               * ``username``: ``user@example.com`` (defined during Astakos sign up)
               * ``container``: ``pithos`` (default, if the Web UI was used)
               * ``filename``: the name of file (visible also from the Web UI)
 * ``img_properties``: taken from the metadata file. Used only the two mandatory
                       properties ``OSFAMILY`` and ``ROOT_PARTITION``. `Learn more
                       <https://code.grnet.gr/projects/snf-image/wiki/Image_Format#Image-Properties>`_

If the ``gnt-instance add`` command returns successfully, then run:

.. code-block:: console

   # gnt-instance info testvm1 | grep "console connection"

to find out where to connect using VNC. If you can connect successfully and can
login to your new instance using the root password ``my_vm_example_passw0rd``,
then everything works as expected and you have your new Debian Base VM up and
running.

If ``gnt-instance add`` fails, make sure that snf-image is correctly configured
to access the Pithos database and the Pithos backend data (newer versions
require UUID instead of a username). Another issue you may encounter is that in
relatively slow setups, you may need to raise the default HELPER_*_TIMEOUTS in
/etc/default/snf-image. Also, make sure you gave the correct ``img_id`` and
``img_properties``. If ``gnt-instance add`` succeeds but you cannot connect,
again find out what went wrong. Do *NOT* proceed to the next steps unless you
are sure everything works till this point.

If everything works, you have successfully connected Ganeti with Pithos. Let's
move on to networking now.

.. warning::

    You can bypass the networking sections and go straight to
    :ref:`Cyclades Ganeti tools <cyclades-gtools>`, if you do not want to setup
    the Cyclades Network Service, but only the Cyclades Compute Service
    (recommended for now).

Networking Setup Overview
-------------------------

This part is deployment-specific and must be customized based on the specific
needs of the system administrator. However, to do so, the administrator needs
to understand how each level handles Virtual Networks, to be able to setup the
backend appropriately, before installing Cyclades. To do so, please read the
:ref:`Network <networks>` section before proceeding.

Since synnefo 0.11 all network actions are managed with the snf-manage
network-* commands. This needs the underlying setup (Ganeti, nfdhcpd,
snf-network, bridges, vlans) to be already configured correctly. The only
actions needed in this point are:

a) Have Ganeti with IP pool management support installed.

b) Install :ref:`snf-network <snf-network>`, which provides a synnefo specific kvm-ifup script, etc.

c) Install :ref:`nfdhcpd <nfdhcpd>`, which serves DHCP requests of the VMs.

In order to test that everything is setup correctly before installing Cyclades,
we will make some testing actions in this section, and the actual setup will be
done afterwards with snf-manage commands.

.. _snf-network:

snf-network
~~~~~~~~~~~

snf-network includes `kvm-vif-bridge` script that is invoked every time
a tap (a VM's NIC) is created. Based on environment variables passed by
Ganeti it issues various commands depending on the network type the NIC is
connected to and sets up a corresponding dhcp lease.

Install snf-network on all Ganeti nodes:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install snf-network

Then, in :file:`/etc/default/snf-network` set:

.. code-block:: console

   MAC_MASK=ff:ff:f0:00:00:00

.. _nfdhcpd:

nfdhcpd
~~~~~~~

Each NIC's IP is chosen by Ganeti (with IP pool management support).
`kvm-vif-bridge` script sets up dhcp leases and when the VM boots and
makes a dhcp request, iptables will mangle the packet and `nfdhcpd` will
create a dhcp response.

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install nfqueue-bindings-python=0.3+physindev-1
   # apt-get install nfdhcpd

Edit ``/etc/nfdhcpd/nfdhcpd.conf`` to reflect your network configuration. At
least, set the ``dhcp_queue`` variable to ``42`` and the ``nameservers``
variable to your DNS IP/s. Those IPs will be passed as the DNS IP/s of your new
VMs. Once you are finished, restart the server on all nodes:

.. code-block:: console

   # /etc/init.d/nfdhcpd restart

If you are using ``ferm``, then you need to run the following:

.. code-block:: console

   # echo "@include 'nfdhcpd.ferm';" >> /etc/ferm/ferm.conf
   # /etc/init.d/ferm restart

or make sure to run after boot:

.. code-block:: console

   # iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p udp -m udp --dport 67 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 42

and if you have IPv6 enabled:

.. code-block:: console

   # ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p ipv6-icmp -m icmp6 --icmpv6-type 133 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 43
   # ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p ipv6-icmp -m icmp6 --icmpv6-type 135 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 44

You can check which clients are currently served by nfdhcpd by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # kill -SIGUSR1 `cat /var/run/nfdhcpd/nfdhcpd.pid`

When you run the above, then check ``/var/log/nfdhcpd/nfdhcpd.log``.

Public Network Setup
--------------------

To achieve basic networking the simplest way is to have a common bridge (e.g.
``br0``, on the same collision domain with the router) where all VMs will
connect to. Packets will be "forwarded" to the router and then to the Internet.
If you want a more advanced setup (ip-less routing and proxy-arp plese refer to
:ref:`Network <networks>` section).

Physical Host Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming ``eth0`` on both hosts is the public interface (directly connected
to the router), run on every node:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install vlan
   # brctl addbr br0
   # ip link set br0 up
   # vconfig add eth0 100
   # ip link set eth0.100 up
   # brctl addif br0 eth0.100


Testing a Public Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's assume, that you want to assign IPs from the ``5.6.7.0/27`` range to you
new VMs, with ``5.6.7.1`` as the router's gateway. In Ganeti you can add the
network by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # gnt-network add --network=5.6.7.0/27 --gateway=5.6.7.1 --network-type=public --tags=nfdhcpd test-net-public

Then, connect the network to all your nodegroups. We assume that we only have
one nodegroup (``default``) in our Ganeti cluster:

.. code-block:: console

   # gnt-network connect test-net-public default bridged br0

Now, it is time to test that the backend infrastracture is correctly setup for
the Public Network. We will add a new VM, the same way we did it on the
previous testing section. However, now will also add one NIC, configured to be
managed from our previously defined network. Run on the GANETI-MASTER (node1):

.. code-block:: console

   # gnt-instance add -o snf-image+default --os-parameters \
                      img_passwd=my_vm_example_passw0rd,img_format=diskdump,img_id="pithos://UUID/pithos/debian_base-6.0-7-x86_64.diskdump",img_properties='{"OSFAMILY":"linux"\,"ROOT_PARTITION":"1"}' \
                      -t plain --disk 0:size=2G --no-name-check --no-ip-check \
                      --net 0:ip=pool,network=test-net-public \
                      testvm2

If the above returns successfully, connect to the new VM and run:

.. code-block:: console

   root@testvm2:~ # ip addr
   root@testvm2:~ # ip route
   root@testvm2:~ # cat /etc/resolv.conf

to check IP address (5.6.7.2), IP routes (default via 5.6.7.1) and DNS config
(nameserver option in nfdhcpd.conf). This shows correct configuration of
ganeti, snf-network and nfdhcpd.

Now ping the outside world. If this works too, then you have also configured
correctly your physical host and router.

Make sure everything works as expected, before proceeding with the Private
Networks setup.

.. _private-networks-setup:

Private Networks Setup
----------------------

Synnefo supports two types of private networks:

 - based on MAC filtering
 - based on physical VLANs

Both types provide Layer 2 isolation to the end-user.

For the first type a common bridge (e.g. ``prv0``) is needed while for the
second a range of bridges (e.g. ``prv1..prv100``) each bridged on a different
physical VLAN. To this end to assure isolation among end-users' private networks
each has to have different MAC prefix (for the filtering to take place) or to be
"connected" to a different bridge (VLAN actually).

Physical Host Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to create the necessary VLAN/bridges, one for MAC filtered private
networks and various (e.g. 20) for private networks based on physical VLANs,
run on every node:

Assuming ``eth0`` of both hosts are somehow (via cable/switch with VLANs
configured correctly) connected together, run on every node:

.. code-block:: console

   # modprobe 8021q
   # $iface=eth0
   # for prv in $(seq 0 20); do
        vlan=$prv
        bridge=prv$prv
        vconfig add $iface $vlan
        ifconfig $iface.$vlan up
        brctl addbr $bridge
        brctl setfd $bridge 0
        brctl addif $bridge $iface.$vlan
        ifconfig $bridge up
      done

The above will do the following :

 * provision 21 new bridges: ``prv0`` - ``prv20``
 * provision 21 new vlans: ``eth0.0`` - ``eth0.20``
 * add the corresponding vlan to the equivalent bridge

You can run ``brctl show`` on both nodes to see if everything was setup
correctly.

Testing the Private Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test the Private Networks, we will create two instances and put them in the
same Private Networks (one MAC Filtered and one Physical VLAN). This means
that the instances will have a second NIC connected to the ``prv0``
pre-provisioned bridge and a third to ``prv1``.

We run the same command as in the Public Network testing section, but with one
more argument for the second NIC:

.. code-block:: console

   # gnt-network add --network=192.168.1.0/24 --mac-prefix=aa:00:55 --network-type=private --tags=nfdhcpd,private-filtered test-net-prv-mac
   # gnt-network connect test-net-prv-mac default bridged prv0

   # gnt-network add --network=10.0.0.0/24 --tags=nfdhcpd --network-type=private test-net-prv-vlan
   # gnt-network connect test-net-prv-vlan default bridged prv1

   # gnt-instance add -o snf-image+default --os-parameters \
                      img_passwd=my_vm_example_passw0rd,img_format=diskdump,img_id="pithos://UUID/pithos/debian_base-6.0-7-x86_64.diskdump",img_properties='{"OSFAMILY":"linux"\,"ROOT_PARTITION":"1"}' \
                      -t plain --disk 0:size=2G --no-name-check --no-ip-check \
                      --net 0:ip=pool,network=test-net-public \
                      --net 1:ip=pool,network=test-net-prv-mac \
                      --net 2:ip=none,network=test-net-prv-vlan \
                      testvm3

   # gnt-instance add -o snf-image+default --os-parameters \
                      img_passwd=my_vm_example_passw0rd,img_format=diskdump,img_id="pithos://UUID/pithos/debian_base-6.0-7-x86_64.diskdump",img_properties='{"OSFAMILY":"linux"\,"ROOT_PARTITION":"1"}' \
                      -t plain --disk 0:size=2G --no-name-check --no-ip-check \
                      --net 0:ip=pool,network=test-net-public \
                      --net 1:ip=pool,network=test-net-prv-mac \
                      --net 2:ip=none,network=test-net-prv-vlan \
                      testvm4

Above, we create two instances with first NIC connected to the internet, their
second NIC connected to a MAC filtered private Network and their third NIC
connected to the first Physical VLAN Private Network. Now, connect to the
instances using VNC and make sure everything works as expected:

 a) The instances have access to the public internet through their first eth
    interface (``eth0``), which has been automatically assigned a public IP.

 b) ``eth1`` will have mac prefix ``aa:00:55``, while ``eth2`` default one (``aa:00:00``)

 c) ip link set ``eth1``/``eth2`` up

 d) dhclient ``eth1``/``eth2``

 e) On testvm3  ping 192.168.1.2/10.0.0.2

If everything works as expected, then you have finished the Network Setup at the
backend for both types of Networks (Public & Private).

.. _cyclades-gtools:

Cyclades Ganeti tools
---------------------

In order for Ganeti to be connected with Cyclades later on, we need the
`Cyclades Ganeti tools` available on all Ganeti nodes (node1 & node2 in our
case). You can install them by running in both nodes:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install snf-cyclades-gtools

This will install the following:

 * ``snf-ganeti-eventd`` (daemon to publish Ganeti related messages on RabbitMQ)
 * ``snf-ganeti-hook`` (all necessary hooks under ``/etc/ganeti/hooks``)
 * ``snf-progress-monitor`` (used by ``snf-image`` to publish progress messages)

Configure ``snf-cyclades-gtools``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package will install the ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-cyclades-gtools-backend.conf``
configuration file. At least we need to set the RabbitMQ endpoint for all tools
that need it:

.. code-block:: console

  AMQP_HOSTS=["amqp://synnefo:example_rabbitmq_passw0rd@node1.example.com:5672"]

The above variables should reflect your :ref:`Message Queue setup
<rabbitmq-setup>`. This file should be editted in all Ganeti nodes.

Connect ``snf-image`` with ``snf-progress-monitor``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, we need to configure ``snf-image`` to publish progress messages during
the deployment of each Image. To do this, we edit ``/etc/default/snf-image`` and
set the corresponding variable to ``snf-progress-monitor``:

.. code-block:: console

   PROGRESS_MONITOR="snf-progress-monitor"

This file should be editted in all Ganeti nodes.

.. _rapi-user:

Synnefo RAPI user
-----------------

As a last step before installing Cyclades, create a new RAPI user that will
have ``write`` access. Cyclades will use this user to issue commands to Ganeti,
so we will call the user ``cyclades`` with password ``example_rapi_passw0rd``.
You can do this, by first running:

.. code-block:: console

   # echo -n 'cyclades:Ganeti Remote API:example_rapi_passw0rd' | openssl md5

and then putting the output in ``/var/lib/ganeti/rapi/users`` as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   cyclades {HA1}55aec7050aa4e4b111ca43cb505a61a0 write

More about Ganeti's RAPI users `here.
<http://docs.ganeti.org/ganeti/2.6/html/rapi.html#introduction>`_

You have now finished with all needed Prerequisites for Cyclades. Let's move on
to the actual Cyclades installation.


Installation of Cyclades on node1
=================================

This section describes the installation of Cyclades. Cyclades is Synnefo's
Compute service. The Image Service will get installed automatically along with
Cyclades, because it is contained in the same Synnefo component.

We will install Cyclades on node1. To do so, we install the corresponding
package by running on node1:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install snf-cyclades-app memcached python-memcache

If all packages install successfully, then Cyclades are installed and we
proceed with their configuration.

Since version 0.13, Synnefo uses the VMAPI in order to prevent sensitive data
needed by 'snf-image' to be stored in Ganeti configuration (e.g. VM password).
This is achieved by storing all sensitive information to a CACHE backend and
exporting it via VMAPI. The cache entries are invalidated after the first
request. Synnefo uses `memcached <http://memcached.org/>`_ as a
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ cache backend.

Configuration of Cyclades
=========================

Conf files
----------

After installing Cyclades, a number of new configuration files will appear under
``/etc/synnefo/`` prefixed with ``20-snf-cyclades-app-``. We will describe here
only the minimal needed changes to result with a working system. In general,
sane defaults have been chosen for the most of the options, to cover most of the
common scenarios. However, if you want to tweak Cyclades feel free to do so,
once you get familiar with the different options.

Edit ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-cyclades-app-api.conf``:

.. code-block:: console

   CYCLADES_BASE_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/cyclades'
   ASTAKOS_BASE_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/astakos'

   # Set to False if astakos & cyclades are on the same host
   CYCLADES_PROXY_USER_SERVICES = False

   CYCLADES_SERVICE_TOKEN = 'cyclades_service_token22w'

The ``ASTAKOS_BASE_URL`` denotes the Astakos endpoint for Cyclades,
which is used for all user management, including authentication.
Since our Astakos, Cyclades, and Pithos installations belong together,
they should all have identical ``ASTAKOS_BASE_URL`` setting
(see also, :ref:`previously <conf-pithos>`).

The ``CYCLADES_BASE_URL`` setting must point to the top-level Cyclades URL.
Appending an extra path (``/cyclades`` here) is recommended in order to
distinguish components, if more than one are installed on the same machine.

The ``CYCLADES_SERVICE_TOKEN`` is the token used for authentication with astakos.
It can be retrieved by running on the Astakos node (node1 in our case):

.. code-block:: console

   # snf-manage component-list

The token has been generated automatically during the :ref:`Cyclades service
registration <services-reg>`.

Edit ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-cyclades-app-cloudbar.conf``:

.. code-block:: console

   CLOUDBAR_LOCATION = 'https://node1.example.com/static/im/cloudbar/'
   CLOUDBAR_SERVICES_URL = 'https://node1.example.com/astakos/ui/get_services'
   CLOUDBAR_MENU_URL = 'https://account.node1.example.com/astakos/ui/get_menu'

``CLOUDBAR_LOCATION`` tells the client where to find the Astakos common
cloudbar. The ``CLOUDBAR_SERVICES_URL`` and ``CLOUDBAR_MENU_URL`` options are
used by the Cyclades Web UI to get from Astakos all the information needed to
fill its own cloudbar. So, we put our Astakos deployment urls there. All the
above should have the same values we put in the corresponding variables in
``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-pithos-webclient-cloudbar.conf`` on the previous
:ref:`Pithos configuration <conf-pithos>` section.

Edit ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-cyclades-app-plankton.conf``:

.. code-block:: console

   BACKEND_DB_CONNECTION = 'postgresql://synnefo:example_passw0rd@node1.example.com:5432/snf_pithos'
   BACKEND_BLOCK_PATH = '/srv/pithos/data/'

In this file we configure the Image Service. ``BACKEND_DB_CONNECTION``
denotes the Pithos database (where the Image files are stored). So we set that
to point to our Pithos database. ``BACKEND_BLOCK_PATH`` denotes the actual
Pithos data location.

Edit ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-cyclades-app-queues.conf``:

.. code-block:: console

   AMQP_HOSTS=["amqp://synnefo:example_rabbitmq_passw0rd@node1.example.com:5672"]

The above settings denote the Message Queue. Those settings should have the same
values as in ``/etc/synnefo/10-snf-cyclades-gtools-backend.conf`` file, and
reflect our :ref:`Message Queue setup <rabbitmq-setup>`.

Edit ``/etc/synnefo/20-snf-cyclades-app-vmapi.conf``:

.. code-block:: console

   VMAPI_CACHE_BACKEND = "memcached://127.0.0.1:11211/?timeout=3600"

Edit ``/etc/default/vncauthproxy``:

.. code-block:: console

   CHUID="nobody:www-data"

We have now finished with the basic Cyclades configuration.

Database Initialization
-----------------------

Once Cyclades is configured, we sync the database:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage syncdb
   $ snf-manage migrate

and load the initial server flavors:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage loaddata flavors

If everything returns successfully, our database is ready.

Add the Ganeti backend
----------------------

In our installation we assume that we only have one Ganeti cluster, the one we
setup earlier.  At this point you have to add this backend (Ganeti cluster) to
cyclades assuming that you have setup the :ref:`Rapi User <rapi-user>`
correctly.

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage backend-add --clustername=ganeti.node1.example.com --user=cyclades --pass=example_rapi_passw0rd

You can see everything has been setup correctly by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage backend-list

Enable the new backend by running:

.. code-block::

   $ snf-manage backend-modify --drained False 1

.. warning:: Since version 0.13, the backend is set to "drained" by default.
    This means that you cannot add VMs to it. The reason for this is that the
    nodes should be unavailable to Synnefo until the Administrator explicitly
    releases them. To change this setting, use ``snf-manage backend-modify
    --drained False <backend-id>``.

If something is not set correctly, you can modify the backend with the
``snf-manage backend-modify`` command. If something has gone wrong, you could
modify the backend to reflect the Ganeti installation by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage backend-modify --clustername "ganeti.node1.example.com"
                               --user=cyclades
                               --pass=example_rapi_passw0rd
                               1

``clustername`` denotes the Ganeti-cluster's name. We provide the corresponding
domain that resolves to the master IP, than the IP itself, to ensure Cyclades
can talk to Ganeti even after a Ganeti master-failover.

``user`` and ``pass`` denote the RAPI user's username and the RAPI user's
password.  Once we setup the first backend to point at our Ganeti cluster, we
update the Cyclades backends status by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage backend-update-status

Cyclades can manage multiple Ganeti backends, but for the purpose of this
guide,we won't get into more detail regarding mulitple backends. If you want to
learn more please see /*TODO*/.

Add a Public Network
----------------------

Cyclades supports different Public Networks on different Ganeti backends.
After connecting Cyclades with our Ganeti cluster, we need to setup a Public
Network for this Ganeti backend (`id = 1`). The basic setup is to bridge every
created NIC on a bridge. After having a bridge (e.g. br0) created in every
backend node edit Synnefo setting CUSTOM_BRIDGED_BRIDGE to 'br0':

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage network-create --subnet=5.6.7.0/27 \
                               --gateway=5.6.7.1 \
                               --subnet6=2001:648:2FFC:1322::/64 \
                               --gateway6=2001:648:2FFC:1322::1 \
                               --public --dhcp --flavor=CUSTOM \
                               --link=br0 --mode=bridged \
                               --name=public_network \
                               --backend-id=1

This will create the Public Network on both Cyclades and the Ganeti backend. To
make sure everything was setup correctly, also run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage reconcile-networks

You can see all available networks by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage network-list

and inspect each network's state by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ snf-manage network-inspect <net_id>

Finally, you can see the networks from the Ganeti perspective by running on the
Ganeti MASTER:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gnt-network list
   $ gnt-network info <network_name>

Create pools for Private Networks
---------------------------------

To prevent duplicate assignment of resources to different private networks,
Cyclades supports two types of pools:

 - MAC prefix Pool
 - Bridge Pool

As long as those resourses have been provisioned, admin has to define two
these pools in Synnefo:


.. code-block:: console

   root@testvm1:~ # snf-manage pool-create --type=mac-prefix --base=aa:00:0 --size=65536

   root@testvm1:~ # snf-manage pool-create --type=bridge --base=prv --size=20

Also, change the Synnefo setting in :file:`20-snf-cyclades-app-api.conf`:

.. code-block:: console

   DEFAULT_MAC_FILTERED_BRIDGE = 'prv0'

Servers restart
---------------

Restart gunicorn on node1:

.. code-block:: console

   # /etc/init.d/gunicorn restart

Now let's do the final connections of Cyclades with Ganeti.

``snf-dispatcher`` initialization
---------------------------------

``snf-dispatcher`` dispatches all messages published to the Message Queue and
manages the Cyclades database accordingly. It also initializes all exchanges. By
default it is not enabled during installation of Cyclades, so let's enable it in
its configuration file ``/etc/default/snf-dispatcher``:

.. code-block:: console

   SNF_DSPTCH_ENABLE=true

and start the daemon:

.. code-block:: console

   # /etc/init.d/snf-dispatcher start

You can see that everything works correctly by tailing its log file
``/var/log/synnefo/dispatcher.log``.

``snf-ganeti-eventd`` on GANETI MASTER
--------------------------------------

The last step of the Cyclades setup is enabling the ``snf-ganeti-eventd``
daemon (part of the :ref:`Cyclades Ganeti tools <cyclades-gtools>` package).
The daemon is already installed on the GANETI MASTER (node1 in our case).
``snf-ganeti-eventd`` is disabled by default during the ``snf-cyclades-gtools``
installation, so we enable it in its configuration file
``/etc/default/snf-ganeti-eventd``:

.. code-block:: console

   SNF_EVENTD_ENABLE=true

and start the daemon:

.. code-block:: console

   # /etc/init.d/snf-ganeti-eventd start

.. warning:: Make sure you start ``snf-ganeti-eventd`` *ONLY* on GANETI MASTER

Apply Quota
-----------

The following commands will check and fix the integrity of user quota.
In a freshly installed system, these commands have no effect and can be
skipped.

.. code-block:: console

   node1 # snf-manage quota --sync
   node1 # snf-manage reconcile-resources-astakos --fix
   node2 # snf-manage reconcile-resources-pithos --fix
   node1 # snf-manage reconcile-resources-cyclades --fix

If all the above return successfully, then you have finished with the Cyclades
installation and setup.

Let's test our installation now.


Testing of Cyclades
===================

Cyclades Web UI
---------------

First of all we need to test that our Cyclades Web UI works correctly. Open your
browser and go to the Astakos home page. Login and then click 'cyclades' on the
top cloud bar. This should redirect you to:

 `http://node1.example.com/cyclades/ui/`

and the Cyclades home page should appear. If not, please go back and find what
went wrong. Do not proceed if you don't see the Cyclades home page.

If the Cyclades home page appears, click on the orange button 'New machine'. The
first step of the 'New machine wizard' will appear. This step shows all the
available Images from which you can spawn new VMs. The list should be currently
empty, as we haven't registered any Images yet. Close the wizard and browse the
interface (not many things to see yet). If everything seems to work, let's
register our first Image file.

Cyclades Images
---------------

To test our Cyclades installation, we will use an Image stored on Pithos to
spawn a new VM from the Cyclades interface. We will describe all steps, even
though you may already have uploaded an Image on Pithos from a :ref:`previous
<snf-image-images>` section:

 * Upload an Image file to Pithos
 * Register that Image file to Cyclades
 * Spawn a new VM from that Image from the Cyclades Web UI

We will use the `kamaki <http://www.synnefo.org/docs/kamaki/latest/index.html>`_
command line client to do the uploading and registering of the Image.

Installation of `kamaki`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install `kamaki` anywhere you like, since it is a standalone client of
the APIs and talks to the installation over `http`. For the purpose of this
guide we will assume that we have downloaded the `Debian Squeeze Base Image
<https://pithos.okeanos.grnet.gr/public/9epgb>`_ and stored it under node1's
``/srv/images`` directory. For that reason we will install `kamaki` on node1,
too. We do this by running:

.. code-block:: console

   # apt-get install kamaki

Configuration of kamaki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we need to setup kamaki, by adding the appropriate URLs and tokens of our
installation. We do this by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kamaki config set cloud.default.url \
       "https://node1.example.com/astakos/identity/v2.0"
   $ kamaki config set cloud.default.token USER_TOKEN

Both the Authentication URL and the USER_TOKEN appear on the user's
`API access` web page on the Astakos Web UI.

You can see that the new configuration options have been applied correctly,
either by checking the editable file ``~/.kamakirc`` or by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kamaki config list

A quick test to check that kamaki is configured correctly, is to try to
authenticate a user based on his/her token (in this case the user is you):

.. code-block:: console

  $ kamaki user authenticate

The above operation provides various user information, e.g. UUID (the unique
user id) which might prove useful in some operations.

Upload an Image file to Pithos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, that we have set up `kamaki` we will upload the Image that we have
downloaded and stored under ``/srv/images/``. Although we can upload the Image
under the root ``Pithos`` container (as you may have done when uploading the
Image from the Pithos Web UI), we will create a new container called ``images``
and store the Image under that container. We do this for two reasons:

a) To demonstrate how to create containers other than the default ``Pithos``.
   This can be done only with the `kamaki` client and not through the Web UI.

b) As a best organization practise, so that you won't have your Image files
   tangled along with all your other Pithos files and directory structures.

We create the new ``images`` container by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kamaki file create images

To check if the container has been created, list all containers of your
account:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kamaki file list

Then, we upload the Image file to that container:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kamaki file upload /srv/images/debian_base-6.0-7-x86_64.diskdump images

The first is the local path and the second is the remote container on Pithos.
Check if the file has been uploaded, by listing the container contents:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kamaki file list images

Alternatively check if the new container and file appear on the Pithos Web UI.

Register an existing Image file to Cyclades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the purposes of the following example, we assume that the user UUID is
``u53r-un1qu3-1d``.

Once the Image file has been successfully uploaded on Pithos then we register
it to Cyclades, by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ kamaki image register "Debian Base" \
                           pithos://u53r-un1qu3-1d/images/debian_base-6.0-7-x86_64.diskdump \
                           --public \
                           --disk-format=diskdump \
                           --property OSFAMILY=linux --property ROOT_PARTITION=1 \
                           --property description="Debian Squeeze Base System" \
                           --property size=451 --property kernel=2.6.32 --property GUI="No GUI" \
                           --property sortorder=1 --property USERS=root --property OS=debian

This command registers the Pithos file
``pithos://u53r-un1qu3-1d/images/debian_base-6.0-7-x86_64.diskdump`` as an
Image in Cyclades. This Image will be public (``--public``), so all users will
be able to spawn VMs from it and is of type ``diskdump``. The first two
properties (``OSFAMILY`` and ``ROOT_PARTITION``) are mandatory. All the rest
properties are optional, but recommended, so that the Images appear nicely on
the Cyclades Web UI. ``Debian Base`` will appear as the name of this Image. The
``OS`` property's valid values may be found in the ``IMAGE_ICONS`` variable
inside the ``20-snf-cyclades-app-ui.conf`` configuration file.

``OSFAMILY`` and ``ROOT_PARTITION`` are mandatory because they will be passed
from Cyclades to Ganeti and then `snf-image` (also see
:ref:`previous section <ganeti-with-pithos-images>`). All other properties are
used to show information on the Cyclades UI.

Spawn a VM from the Cyclades Web UI
-----------------------------------

If the registration completes successfully, then go to the Cyclades Web UI from
your browser at:

 `https://node1.example.com/cyclades/ui/`

Click on the 'New Machine' button and the first step of the wizard will appear.
Click on 'My Images' (right after 'System' Images) on the left pane of the
wizard. Your previously registered Image "Debian Base" should appear under
'Available Images'. If not, something has gone wrong with the registration. Make
sure you can see your Image file on the Pithos Web UI and ``kamaki image
register`` returns successfully with all options and properties as shown above.

If the Image appears on the list, select it and complete the wizard by selecting
a flavor and a name for your VM. Then finish by clicking 'Create'. Make sure you
write down your password, because you *WON'T* be able to retrieve it later.

If everything was setup correctly, after a few minutes your new machine will go
to state 'Running' and you will be able to use it. Click 'Console' to connect
through VNC out of band, or click on the machine's icon to connect directly via
SSH or RDP (for windows machines).

Congratulations. You have successfully installed the whole Synnefo stack and
connected all components. Go ahead in the next section to test the Network
functionality from inside Cyclades and discover even more features.
