Component astakosclient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Synnefo component :ref:`astakosclient <astakosclient>` defines a
default client for the :ref:`Astakos <astakos>` service. It is designed to be
simple and minimal, hence easy to debug and test.

It uses the user's authentication token to query Astakos for:

    * User's info
    * Usernames for given UUIDs
    * UUIDs for given usernames
    * User's quotas

It can also query Astakos with another service's (Cyclades or Pithos)
authentication token for:

    * Usernames for given UUIDs
    * UUIDs for given usernames
    * Quotas for all related resources
    * Issue commissions
    * Get pending commissions
    * Accept or reject commissions

Additionally, there are options for using the `objpool
<https://github.com/grnet/objpool>`_ library to pool the http connections.


Basic example
=============

The ``astakosclient`` module provides the ``AstakosClient`` class. This section
demonstrates how to get user's info using ``astakosclient``.

.. code-block:: python

    from astakosclient import AstakosClient

    client = AstakosClient("https://accounts.example.com")
    user_info = client.get_user_info("UQpYas7ElzWGD5yCcEXtjw")
    print user_info['username']

Another example where we ask for the username of a user with UUID:
``b3de8eb0-3958-477e-als9-789af8dd352c``

.. code-block:: python

    from astakosclient import AstakosClient

    client = AstakosClient("https://accounts.example.com")
    username = client.get_username("UQpYas7ElzWGD5yCcEXtjw",
                                   "b3de8eb0-3958-477e-als9-789af8dd352c")
    print username


Classes and functions
=====================

This section describes in depth the API of ``astakosclient``.

Astakos Client
--------------

*class* astakosclient.\ **AstakosClient(**\ astakos_url,
retry=0, use_pool=False, pool_size=8, logger=None\ **)**

    Initialize an instance of **AstakosClient** given the *astakos_url*.
    Optionally one can specify if we are going to use a pool, the pool_size
    and the number of retries if the connection fails.

    This class provides the following methods:

    **get_user_info(**\ token, usage=False\ **)**
        Given a user's authentication token it returns a dict with the
        correspoinding user's info. If usage is set to True more
        information about user's resources will be returned.
        In case of error raise an AstakosClientException exception.

    **get_usernames(**\ token, uuids\ **)**
        Given a user's authentication token and a list of UUIDs
        return a uuid_catalog, that is a dictionary with the given
        UUIDs as keys and the corresponding user names as values.
        Invalid UUIDs will not be in the dictionary.
        In case of error raise an AstakosClientException exception.

    **get_username(**\ token, uuid\ **)**
        Given a user's authentication token and a UUID (as string)
        return the corresponding user name (as string).
        In case of invalid UUID raise NoUserName exception.
        In case of error raise an AstakosClientException exception.

    **service_get_usernames(**\ token, uuids\ **)**
        Same as get_usernames but called with a service's token.

    **service_get_username(**\ token, uuid\ **)**
        Same as get_username but called with a service's token.

    **get_uuids(**\ token, display_names\ **)**
        Given a user's authentication token and a list of usernames
        return a displayname_catalog, that is a dictionary with the given
        usernames as keys and the corresponding UUIDs as values.
        Invalid usernames will not be in the dictionary.
        In case of error raise an AstakosClientException exception.

    **get_uuid(**\ token, display_name\ **)**
        Given a user's authentication token and a username (as string)
        return the corresponding UUID (as string).
        In case of invalid user name raise NoUUID exception.
        In case of error raise an AstakosClientException exception.

    **service_get_uuids(**\ token, uuids\ **)**
        Same as get_uuids but called with a service's token.

    **service_get_uuid(**\ token, uuid\ **)**
        Same as get_uuid but called with a service's token.

    **get_services()**
        Return a list of dicts with the registered services.

    **get_resources()**
        Return a list of dicts with the available resources

    **send_feedback(**\ token, message, data\ **)**
        Using a user's authentication token send some feedback to
        astakos service. Additional information about the service
        client status can be given in the data variable.
        In case of success returns nothing.
        Otherwise raise an AstakosClientException exception.

    **get_endpoints(**\ token, uuid=None\ **)**
        Fallback call which receives the user token or the user uuid/token
        and returns back the token as well as information about the token
        holder and the services he/seh can access.
        In case of error raise an AstakosClientException exception.

    **get_quotas(**\ token\ **)**
